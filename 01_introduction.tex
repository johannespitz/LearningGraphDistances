\section{Introduction}

In this report I summarize the work I did during my guided research. The main part of the report is focuses on the findings that are relevant to a potential paper submission, while in the appendix I will write more about the process and some of the less important work I have done.

The main part of the report starts with an analysis of related work in the area of graph distance learning and graph matching. Then \dots

Main contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Propose method for graph distance learing that scales to larger graphs. \\ (With Nystrom/Multiscale $\rightarrow$ First sub $n^2$ that scales to larger graphs).
    \item Experimentaly show that it outperforms other methods on task of Graph Edit Distance estimation.
    \item Show that our application of sinkhorn has advantages over previous work.
\end{itemize}

In summary \dots
