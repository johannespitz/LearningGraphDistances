\section{Related Work}

Graphs are intersting because you can represent anything as a graph.
Convolutional networks were extremly successful \cite{alexnet2012}.
Graph Convolution Network, Kipf and Welling \cite{kipf2017}.
Most research involving deep learning and graphs has focused on node and graph classification, but recently researchers have started applying these tools to the problem of graph distance estimation.

Riba et al. \cite{riba2018} proposed a siamese network consistis of two GCN and then Hausdorf Distance (chamfer).

Bai et al. \cite{bai2019} proposed to use attention to aggregate the embeddings and addtionally use histogram of pairwise distances (though not backpropable).
CNN1 \cite{bai2018_cnn1} \cite{bai2018_cnn2} requires somewhat arbitrary ordering.

Li et al. \cite{li2019} proposed to use allow messages passed from one graph to the other via cross-graph matching vector.

Fey at al. \cite{fey2020_update} propsed to use sinkhorn matching after GCN (and consensus stuff, which is not relevant to our work)
