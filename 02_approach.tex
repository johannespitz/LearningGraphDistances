\section{Approach}

Siamese GCN.
Set up cost matrix (bp vs. normal, scale with $\alpha$).
Compoute explicit matching with sinkhorn (use cost matrix as kernel, can tune $\lambda$).
Use optimal matching for backprop.
Multiply matching with cost matrix.

% Exactly solving this constrained optimization
% program would yield the exact GED solution
% (Fankhauser, Riesen, and Bunke 2011), but it is NPcomplete since it is equivalent to finding an optimal matching in a complete bipartite graph (Riesen and Bunke 2009).
% To efficiently solve the assignment problem, the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn 1955) and the Volgenant Jonker (VJ)
% (Jonker and Volgenant 1987) algorithm are commonly used,
% which both run in cubic time. In contrast, GSimCNN takes
% advantage of the exact solutions of the instances of this problem during the training stage, and computes the approximate
% GED during testing in quadratic time, without the need for
% solving any optimization problem for a new graph pair.
