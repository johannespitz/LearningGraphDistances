\section{Outlook}

ensure all properties of a metric/distance
translational invariance of metric
homogeneity (alpha * graph)

triangle inequality

while it seems inevidable that the whole thins is quadratic in the end, we might actually be albe to get linear run time by using nystrom or multiscale matching.
